      <h1>About Safe Space Project</h1>
      <p>My name is Lillian and this is my final ACA project! I have been a strong womenâ€™s rights activist for years and I knew this was a needed resource with all of the negative stigma around domestic violence. My project will eventually consist of creating a map of all the battered women's shelters in the United States, starting with Texas. My ultimate goal for this project was for it to be a safe space where women could find a shelter near them should they ever find themselves in a situation where they may need to seek help.</p>
