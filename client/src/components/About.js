        <h1>About Safe Space Project</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          My name is Lillian and this is my final ACA project!<br />
          <br />I have been a strong proponent of women's rights for years and I knew this was a needed resource with all of the negative
          stigma around victims of domestic violence. In addition to battered women's shelters, there will also be listings for resources
          around substance abuse, counseling, and support services.<br />
          <br />My project will eventually consist of creating a map of women's shelters in the United States, starting with Texas. My
          ultimate goal for this project was for it to be a safe space where women could find a shelter near them should they ever find
          themselves in a situation where they may need to seek help.
